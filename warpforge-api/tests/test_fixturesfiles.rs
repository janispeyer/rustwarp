Notes on ways to handle fixture testing:

- rust out-of-box does not support dynamic test names.
	- And they have the typical (pretty valid) reasoning of wanting to be able to enumerate test names statically.
		- There's a discussion on https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/dynamic-tests-revisited/18095 but so far it lands somewhere pretty conservative.
	- But of course, this is rust, so we also have macros.  Which means Anything Is Possible.

Okay so who can help?

- rstest looks glorious in a lot of ways, but...
	- I haven't found an incantation that lets it generate a whole bunch of cases at once, yet.
- https://docs.rs/datatest/latest/datatest/ is neat and looks close to the mark...
	- and it even explicitly has a bunch of filesystem features built right in!  Nice!
	- except it requires a test runner, which is an odd requirement?  I think this should be possible with just proc macros.
		- Depending on `#![feature(custom_test_frameworks)]` seems like its entering deep water.
			- I'm really trying hard not to have to opt in to nightly compilers.
	- I have not yet analyzed if this has a fixture regen features.
- ...That's all I could find.

Are we gonna just do this again ourselves?  Ugh.  Apparently, yes.

"testfiles-derive" crate, here we come.

// Fixture files for the API have a simple format:
// the serial document starts right away, with no preamble;
// at some point, there's a "---" on a line by itself;
// and expectation information is below that.
//
// The aim of this format is to make it very easy to see line numbers in the main document.
// (We're interested in writing tests that include making sure parse *errors* from that
// document have good line and column offset info.  Making that easy to eyeball helps!)
//
// We made our own test_per_file macro to power this.
// Okay the amazing thing is, it works.
// The mild bummer thing is, I think VSCode's integrations making a "Run Test" button are going for a specific name, and filter it back out.  I don't know how others like `rstest` get around this (or if they're just blessed at this point).
// Ah, yes, and of course the murderously bad thing is... cargo test caching is too smart.
